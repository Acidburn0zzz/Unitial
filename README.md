This is a beta verion
=====================
no dangerous and harm, but it's not complete!

Unitial
=======
Automatic initialize environment for Unix-like operating system!


Introduction
============
I hope to make a script to initialize the environment for friendly use in Unix-like OS,

Currently, I can only aim(and test) at FreeBSD and most Linux distros.

If you are interesting in the very small project, welcome to fork and feedback, or join it!

If there is any question and suggestion, please let me know, thanks.


How to use it?
==============
First :

(if you are using FreeBSD, please use fetch instead of wget)
wget https://raw.github.com/PeterDaveHello/Unitial/master/setup.sh

Second :

chmod +x setup.sh

Third :

./setup.sh

And all works will be done in seconds.

If you know how to use git and already installed it, you can also clone this repo, but there is no need.

I hope it can be used very easy! And if you got git on your machine, maybe you already initialized it by yourself:)

This is design for whom? and for what?
======================================
Originally, this is used for myself only, I hate to configure in a new environment everytime!

I think that maybe I can share it to someone else, so I did some modify and upload on github! 


What's in it?
=============
Bash/tcsh/csh Shell :
auto completion(BASH only), useful alias, keymap issue for many user

Vim :
useful setting and comfortable color scheme

Git :
useful alias and setting, auto completion in BASH


Notes
=====
Currently, I only test on FreeBSD and Linux distros, if it's not work, please tell me to fix.
